File needs some dependencies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 - Community edition (free) "In the setup phase, you'll only need the Desktop Development with C++ Package"
2. It will probably ask you to restart your computer.
3. Open your IDE of choice and install the dependencies: -cmake -dlib -face_recognition -numpy -opencvpython (pip install "dependencies listed")
4. You're all set. Download the face you want, name it as test.png/jpg and run the program using (python main.py)
5. You can use the faces folder to upload new faces so the program recognizes the ones you want. Right now, it only recognizes the ones inside of the folder.
